Problem Statment:  Cash Flow Minimizer

Description:
•	Represent cash flow data as a time series or sequence using an appropriate data structure (e.g., array, linked list).
•	Implement algorithms to identify and categorize income and expense transactions.
•	Use sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) to order transactions chronologically.
•	Implement data structures like stacks or queues to handle transaction dependencies and scheduling.
•	Utilize dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to minimize cash flow by rescheduling transactions.
•	Incorporate constraints like due dates, penalties, and interest rates.
•	Provide a user interface for inputting transaction data and displaying optimized cash flow schedules.
•	Handle error checking and input validation for transaction data.
•	Consider integrating with financial databases or APIs for real- world data.	Hard	DS_08
